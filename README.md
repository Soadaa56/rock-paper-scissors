 This will start as a simple rock, paper, scissors game to be played in the dev console of the webpage. I will eventually comeback to this project to incorporate it into the webpage with buttons. The goal is start and finish my first JavaScript project on my own (along with practicing git commits and messages).

 The first file /js/game.js is my first attempt to make the game without following any instructions from 'The Odin Project' page nor looking at other submissions.

 The second file ./js/game_2.js will be my second attempt after viewing other solutions to this problem and following the assignment step by step on 'The Odin Project'.
